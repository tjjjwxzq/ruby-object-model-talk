# RDRC and RubyConfMY 2017 Talk Materials

**All I'd Wanted to Know About Ruby's Object Model Starting Out, and MOOOARR!!!**

Same talk, first given at RDRC'17, with more content added for RubyConfMY'17, due to the slightly longer duration allotted.

Slides, and notes I took as I was trying to wrap my head around CRuby source (actually dug into quite a bit more than I covered in my talk, because I wanted to be surer of what I was presenting. Reading source code is hard :( ).

I talk about:
- Ruby's class hierarchy
- singleton classes and metaclasses
- how data is represented in CRuby
- method lookup
- modules
- attribute lookup

Will probably be quite a while before I give a talk at any other conf, I think.
